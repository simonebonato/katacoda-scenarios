## Continuous Integration (CI) for Machine Learning using CML library 
CML (Continuous Machine Learning) is an open-source library created to allow the implementation of CI/CD pipelines in Machine Learning projects. It can be used to automate the development and deployment of ML models, facilitating users to compare the performance of various ML models, directly on GitHub.

In this simple tutorial we will show you how, with just a few lines of code, we can print out a markdown file containing all the relevant information (model accuracy, loss score, graphs, etc.) directly on the PR page. So that everyone on the team has a fast and direct way to analyze whether there have been improvements with the new versions of the ML model.
