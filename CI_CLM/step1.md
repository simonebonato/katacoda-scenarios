## Setting up the GitHub repo.

In this first part of the tutorial you will have set up the GitHub repository that you will then use for the rest of the tutorial. It will simply contain these 2 files:
* main.py -> a Python script that trains a ML model, saves a file called "results.txt" containing the best accuracies for the training and validation sets, and the plots of the accuracy and the loss of the model during the training.
* requirements.txt -> a text file with all the Python packages the code in main.py needs to run

The first thing to do is go to the following [link](https://github.com/vishalned/CI-with-CML) and fork the repository as shown in the picture below.

Now you will have an exact copy of the repository in which you can make changes and where you will be performing the rest of the tutorial. 
At this point you can clone the repository on your local machine, however this part is not necessary and the next steps can be carried out even on GitHub directly.

Congrats! We can move on to the next step.
